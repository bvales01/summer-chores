Summer Chores: JavaScript Callbacks

This project is a JavaScript simulation of a Saturday chore rountine, exploring asynchronous programming. 
The program simulates a person's energy levels throughout the day. As chores progress, there is a randomized chance the person will become too tired and fall asleep before completing the remaining chores. 

This repository demonstrates: 
- Callback Functions
- Asynchronous Execution
- Control Flow
- Node.js

Chore List & Time completion(ms): 
- Mowing the Yard, 2000
- Weed eating, 1500
- Trimming Hedges, 1000
- Collecting Wood, 2500
- Watering the Garden, 500

HOW TO RUN: 
1. Have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repo or download the files.
3. Open tour terminal and navigate to the projects folder.
4. Run the following command:
    node callbackVersion.js
    Run it a few times - sometimes you'll finish, sometimes you will fall asleep!
